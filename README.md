# WFP-data-analysis

This project focuses on Food Price Analysis for Pakistan.  The system is designed for World Food Programme dataset (WFP) of Pakistn to analyze historical food price data obtained from their Price Database. The system leverages machine learning and data analysis techniques to gain insights into food price trends, relationships between different food items, and the impact of price changes on vulnerable populations.

This project includes:
 Data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation for analysis.
 Identifying trends in food prices over time (long-term and seasonal).
 Analyzing relationships and dependencies between different food items.
 Assessing the impact of external factors (e.g., oil prices) on food prices.
 Estimating the economic impact of potential food price increases on non-qualified labor.
 Comparing food price trends across Pakistan's provinces.
 Recommending policies to mitigate the impact of food price increases on specific food groups.
 Developing a user-friendly interface for visualizing and exploring analysis results.

The project excludes:
 Real-time data collection or integration with external data sources beyond the WFP Price Database.
 Developing a mobile application or other deployment methods beyond a desktop application.
 Advanced economic modeling or forecasting capabilities beyond basic impact estimations.
The Food Price Analysis System will:
 Preprocess and analyze food price data from the WFP Price Database.
 Identify trends in food prices over time.
 Analyze relationships between different food items.
 Assess the impact of factors like oil prices on food prices.
 Estimate the economic impact of potential food price increases on non-qualified labor.
 Compare food price trends across Pakistan's provinces.
 Suggest policies to mitigate the impact of food price increases on specific food groups.
 Provide a user-friendly interface to visualize analysis results.
